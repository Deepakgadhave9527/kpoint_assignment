# Movie Data App

This project is a React-based web application that displays movies filtered by genre and year using data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## Features

- Display movies categorized by release year.
- Filter movies by genre (Action, Comedy, Horror, Drama, Science Fiction).
- Infinite scrolling for loading more movies.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-data-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your TMDb API key:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_tmdb_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the [TMDb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

5. **View the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Movie Data App.

## Additional Details

- The application fetches movie data using the TMDb API. Ensure your API key is correctly set up in the `.env` file for proper data fetching.
- The project utilizes React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing state and API requests.
- Responsive design is achieved using CSS media queries to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices.
